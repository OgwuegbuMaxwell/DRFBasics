DRFBasics is a Django REST Framework project designed to showcase the implementation of various CRUD operations using different types of viewsâ€”function-based views, class-based views, and mixins. This project serves as an introductory guide to understanding and utilizing Django REST Framework's capabilities for building RESTful APIs, featuring operations on models such as Students, Employees, Products, and Sales.
